Well it's actually usable now! Will try not to brick your machine <3
Assembly references are not supported (except for stuff in the interop folder.) If there is something you want me to add interop functionality to, just ask. However,
*any public fields not in the interop folder are liable to be changed or reworked without prior notification. use at your own risk*

Todo:

 - Portal staticmover enable/disable stuff
 - Cassette gate
 - Debris accellerator
 - Secret <3

 Potential performance/cleanup things:
  - MipGrid cache cleanup?
